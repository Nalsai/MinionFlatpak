# Minion Flatpak

ðŸ“¦ Flatpak Package of MMOUI Minion for Linux

Minion is a multi-platform application which allows users to browse, download, update and manage AddOns for supported games (Elder Scrolls Online and World of Warcraft).

Find out more about Minion on its website: <https://minion.gg/>

This Flatpak uses Azul's OpenJDK 8 Distribution with OpenJFX (ZuluFX) to run Minion natively on Linux.
A wrapper script allows the built-in updater to work by downloading updates to $XDG_DATA_HOME (`~/.var/app/gg.minion.Minion/data`) and running them from there.
By default, the Flatpak has access to `xdg-documents` and `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/306130/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns`. If your AddOn folder is located somewhere else you need to give permission using Flatseal or `flatpak override gg.minion.Minion --filesystem=<path_here>`.
The config files of minion are located in `~/.minion` because it doesn't respect the XDG Base Directory Specification (Â¬_Â¬").

## Installing
